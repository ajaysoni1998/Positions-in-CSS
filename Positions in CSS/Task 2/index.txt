Difference between absolute and relative positioning:
1. Relative positioning maintains the element's place in the normal document flow, while absolute positioning removes it from the flow.

2. Relative positioning is based on the element's original position and moves it from there, whereas absolute positioning is based on its nearest positioned ancestor or the viewport.

3. Elements with absolute positioning can overlap other elements, which is not the case with relative positioning.

4. Absolute positioning is often used for creating overlays, pop-up windows, and floating elements, while relative positioning is used when you want to make minor adjustments to an element's 
   position without taking it out of the document flow.
